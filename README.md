# API-Builder XML-Flow node

Use this extension to add an XML-Flow node to your API-Builder project. With that you can convert XML-Payload you may have received from a backend stream into Javascript Object for further processing or directly into a JSON-String. That allows you to easily merge data from different sources and formats into a JSON-Based-REST-API.
